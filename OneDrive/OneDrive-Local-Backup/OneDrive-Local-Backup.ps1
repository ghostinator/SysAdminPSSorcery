.SYNOPSIS
    Backs up only the files from a OneDrive folder that are physically stored on the local disk.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script is designed to perform a safe backup of a OneDrive folder by copying only the files
    that are fully available offline. It inspects the file attributes to specifically ignore any
    cloud-only placeholders ("Files On-Demand"), thus preventing the OneDrive client from
    triggering unwanted downloads. This is especially useful when the OneDrive sync client is
    unstable or broken, and a reliable local backup is needed before a system reset or migration.
