## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Before Running

- **Backup user data**: Ensure OneDrive files are backed up or synced elsewhere
- **Test in lab environment**: Validate the script works in your specific environment
- **User communication**: Notify users about the change to avoid confusion


### Limitations

- **Active OneDrive sync**: The script doesn't handle files currently syncing
- **User notification**: Users aren't automatically notified of the change
- **Dropbox installation**: The script assumes Dropbox is already installed
- **Office versions**: Primarily tested with Office 2016-2021 and Microsoft 365


### Security Considerations

- Requires administrator privileges
- Modifies system-wide registry settings
- Loads/unloads user registry hives
- Should be tested before production deployment


## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Access Denied" errors**: Ensure script runs as Administrator
2. **Registry hive load failures**: Check if user profiles are corrupted
3. **OneDrive still appears**: Clear Office cache and restart Office applications
4. **Log file missing**: Verify C:\temp directory permissions

### Verification Steps

```powershell
# Check if OneDrive is uninstalled
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*OneDrive*"}

# Verify Dropbox registry entries
Get-ChildItem "Registry::HKEY_USERS\*\Software\Microsoft\Office\Common\Cloud Storage" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```
