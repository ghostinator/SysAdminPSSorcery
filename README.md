# SysAdminPSSorcery

Welcome to SysAdminPSSorcery, a collection of PowerShell scripts crafted by Brandon Cook to tackle various system administration challenges. This repository serves as a growing compendium of useful scripts aimed at automating tasks, simplifying configurations, and enhancing efficiency in managing IT environments. More categories and scripts will be added to this collection over time.

The scripts within this collection currently cover several key areas of system administration, including:

  * **365 Apps:** Utilities for managing and configuring Microsoft 365 applications on client machines.
  * **Azure:** Scripts for managing resources and services within the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.
  * **EntraID:** Tools specifically for managing Microsoft Entra ID users and objects.
  * **ExchangeOnline:** Utilities for administering Exchange Online environments, including mailbox management, user provisioning, and configuration tasks.
  * **Networking:** Scripts focused on network-related operations, potentially covering tasks like configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
  * **OneDrive:** A collection of scripts designed to manage, clean up, or back up OneDrive installations and data on local machines.
  * **SharePoint:** Tools for managing SharePoint Online or on-premises environments, focusing on data migration and access.
  * **Teams:** Scripts and tools tailored for the administration and management of Microsoft Teams.
  * **Windows:** A suite of scripts for advanced configuration, management, and troubleshooting of Windows client and server operating systems.

These scripts are provided to help fellow system administrators in their day-to-day tasks. While efforts are made to ensure their effectiveness, always test scripts in a non-production environment before implementing them widely.
