# SysAdminPSSorcery

Welcome to SysAdminPSSorcery, a collection of PowerShell scripts crafted by Brandon Cook to tackle various system administration challenges. This repository serves as a growing compendium of useful scripts aimed at automating tasks, simplifying configurations, and enhancing efficiency in managing IT environments. More categories and scripts will be added to this collection over time.

The scripts within this collection currently cover several key areas of system administration, including:

* **Azure:** Scripts for managing resources and services within the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.
* **Exchange Online:** Utilities for administering Exchange Online environments, including mailbox management, user provisioning, and configuration tasks.
* **Networking:** Scripts focused on network-related operations, potentially covering tasks like configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
* **SharePoint:** Tools for managing SharePoint Online or on-premises environments.

These scripts are provided to help fellow system administrators in their day-to-day tasks. While efforts are made to ensure their effectiveness, always test scripts in a non-production environment before implementing them widely.
